# Benefactors

Benefactors is a stealth-oriented gamemode for the popular Sandbox game, Garry's Mod. Inspired after Splinter Cell: Blacklist's multiplayer gamemode, Spies VS Mercs, the gamemode is set in the Half-Life 2 universe, sometime during the events between the chapters Entanglement and Anticitizen One.

The objective of the gamemode is for the attacking team, the Resistance, to successfully steal the intelligence briefcase from the defending team, the Benefactors. The gameplay is primarily designed with stealth in mind. Because the defending team has vastly superior armaments and equipment, the attacking team must use stealth and their various gadgets to commit subterfuge and sabotage.
