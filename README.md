# Benefactors

Benefactors is a stealth-oriented gamemode for the popular Sandbox game, Garry's Mod. Inspired after Splinter Cell: Blacklist's competitive multiplayer mode, Spies VS Mercs, this gamemode is set sometime during the events of Half-Life 2's "Entanglement" and "Anticitizen One" chapters.

The objective is for the attacking team, the Resistance, to successfully steal the intelligence briefcase from the defending team, the Benefactors. The gameplay is primarily designed with stealth in mind, and because the defending team has vastly superior armaments and equipment, the attacking team must use stealth and their various gadgets to commit subterfuge and sabotage in order to succeed.
